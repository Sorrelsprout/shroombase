<h2>How did this get started?</h2>
<p style="max-width: 680px; margin: auto;" class="aboutSection">Searching for fungi that fall under specific attributes (tree types, regions) while also having photos that clearly show identification attributes has been difficult to do online. Although there are many awesome resources out there that classify fungi well, this site seeks to simplify and create a visually-oriented profile system for select fungi, which can be understood by hobbyists and those new to the fungi world.</p>
