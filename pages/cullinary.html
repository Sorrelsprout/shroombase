        <li><strong>Why it works</strong> - Overcooking mushrooms is hard to do because of their chitin-containing exterior. Since choice grocery mushrooms are generally spongy, they can absorb a lot of liquid. After frying initially with water, the exterior firms up and is saturated with water. After oil is introduced, it sticks to the exterior (on top of the water) and the mushroom can be sautéed effectively.</li>
